I do freedom tech stuff. I rant about lightning. I'm interested in AI. I want to combine all of these (minus the ranting) into something that pushes the quest for freedom one step forward.

I build various things - check them out [here](https://github.com/aljazceru?ref=disobey.dev). I run a few [directories](https://disobey.dev/directories/). You can see a list of talks, interviews and podcasts, together with slides I've done here. I started and failed a lightning network company - Bolt Observer. Our mission was  making lightning nodes less painful to run, but we were way too early and the market was too small. You can read more about our adventures on [blog.bolt.observer](https://blog.bolt.observer/).

I started Bitcoin Ljubljana meetup in order to have more people to talk about Bitcoin with. It has become very successful and ended up being much more than just that. You can read the story about it [here](https://disobey.dev/posts/the-history-of-bitcoin-ljubljana/).

I was part of the experiment called SEC-01, short for [Sovereign Engineering Cohort](https://sovereignengineering.io/) where a bunch of us freedom tech pirates experimented with nostr and other technologies over the course of two months.
