Somewhere a True Believer is building tools to free you. He is building with minimum resources, in austere conditions, day and night. The only thing dear to him are his tools, and he made them from second hand parts. He doesn't worry about what to build - he builds what he knows, what inspires him. His building ends when the enemy is gone. The True Believer doesn't care how hard it is; he only knows that he wins or he dies. He doesn't go home at 1700; he is home. He knows only the cause.
