This brief article discusses a historical narrative about cryptography rather than cryptocurrency. The author clarifies that "crypto in this case stands for cryptography, as it is for a long time before shitcoins came into existence."

The piece references Paul Rosenberg's work *A Lodging of Wayfaring Men* and notes that an audiobook version was created by Max Hillebrand. However, the main focus is directing readers to an earlier story titled *The Untold Story of the Greatest Crypto Project Ever*, which the author suggests may have inspired Rosenberg's book.

## Key Points

Since the original blog posts are no longer available on Rosenberg's website, the author has compiled links to archived versions of the story across six installments (Introduction and Parts 1-6), primarily hosted on freedomsphoenix.com and the Internet Archive.

The author presents this narrative as valuable for understanding cypherpunk and anarcho-capitalist ideas from the 1990s, describing it as "a great starting point" for deeper exploration of these historical movements and their key figures.
