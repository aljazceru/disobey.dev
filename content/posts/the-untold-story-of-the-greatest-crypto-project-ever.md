If you only clicked on the post to tell me crypto sucks let me disappoint - crypto in this case stands for cryptography, as it is for a long time before shitcoins came into existence.

Many of you might have read Paul Rosenberg's amazing [A lodging of wayfaring men](https://freemansperspective.com/product/a-lodging-of-wayfaring-men/?ref=disobey.dev). Some of you might even know that Max Hillebrand recently created an [audiobook version of it](https://freemansperspective.com/audiobook-a-lodging-of-wayfaring-men/?ref=disobey.dev).

But there is a story that predates that book, a real story that probably served as an inspiration for A lodging of wayfaring men. That story is called [The Untold Story of the Greatest Crypto Project Ever](https://freemansperspective.com/product/the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-e-book/?ref=disobey.dev). If you are too cheap to buy it (you should support Paul, he is a legend!) there is a way to read it free as it was published as blog posts.

It took a bit to dig them up since the originals on his blog are not available anymore but I think the story is too inspiring not to be shared.

Here they are: [Introduction](https://web.archive.org/web/20221006080808/https:/freemansperspective.com/untold-story-greatest-crypto-project-ever-introduction/) , [Part 1](https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/254699-2019-01-17-the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-part.htm?ref=disobey.dev), [Part 2](https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/255038-2019-01-24-the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-part.htm?ref=disobey.dev), [Part 3](https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/255408-2019-01-31-the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-part.htm?ref=disobey.dev), [Part 4](https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/255758-2019-02-07-the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-part.htm?ref=disobey.dev), [Part 5](https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/256127-2019-02-14-the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-part.htm?ref=disobey.dev) and [Part 6](https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Article/256562-2019-02-22-the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever-part.htm?ref=disobey.dev).

This story is a great starting point to dig further into people involved and their cypherpunk and anarhocapitalist ideas from the 90s. Maybe more on that in another post.
