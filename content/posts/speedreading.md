Today I came across [this tweet](https://x.com/i/status/2011227134556348544) about speed reading  and I was immediately intrigued. I was a fan of it back in my younger days when I wanted to consume as much knowledge as possible. I never had the patience to become very proficient in it but I did pick up a thing or two. I'm still generally a fairly fast reader, even when I read for pleasure. But who wouldn't want to read more books?

We all know what is the first thought that goes through your mind when you have several llm subscriptions and you come across something even mildly interesting. I NEED TO BUILD THIS. 

### A few tokens later...

[speedreading.disobey.dev](https://speedreading.disobey.dev). All the processing is done on the client side. You can either paste the text or upload a file (pdf,txt,epub*).

Have fun.
