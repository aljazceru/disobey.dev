The author shares their practice of maintaining public research bookmark repositories on GitHub, initially created to share resources with friends discussing various topics. Several of these collections have gained popularity.

## Featured Directories

**nostr.net** - A comprehensive directory of Nostr resources. Originally a GitHub repository, it "got big enough that its starting to warrant a redesign" and later received its own domain.

**ungovernable.tech** - Started as research bookmarks exploring confidential data vending machines. It has evolved into a work-in-progress consolidation of research around technologies offering "better alternative to the current big brother dystopia of centralized dragnets."

**dlc.wiki** - A collection focused on discreet log contracts. Though the author isn't actively researching this topic, it remains updated through community contributions.

**lightning-network.tech** - Contains resources for Lightning Network node operators, maintained intermittently by the author.

**lightning-landscape.net** - An under-construction project attempting to create an accessible directory with easier community participation, currently paused due to operational costs.

**world-backup** - A GitHub repository curating essential information for emergency scenarios, including manuals and critical data like maps for portable drives.

The author reflects that these directories hopefully have provided value to others exploring these emerging technologies and protocols.
