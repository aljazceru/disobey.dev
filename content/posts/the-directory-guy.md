I've started a practice of keeping my research bookmarks in a public github repository couple years back. Initially it was just so I could easily point my friends somewhere when they started asking questions about the topics we were discussing. Some of them became quite popular, the others not so much (I forgot about one when writing this post).

### nostr.net

I've written about awesome-nostr [before](https://disobey.dev/awesome-nostr/), but to summarize - its a long list of everything nostr. It got big enough that its starting to warrant a redesign , but it still does the job. It started as a github repo that later got its domain - [nostr.net](https://nostr.net).

### ungovernable.tech

[ungovernable.tech](https://ungovernable.tech) started as bookmarks from my exploration into creating confidential data vending machines at SEC-01. Later it snowballed into (still heavily WIP) my attempt to consolidate some of my thinking and research around technologies that have the promise to enable better alternative to the current big brother dystopia of centralized dragnets.

### dlc.wiki

[dlc.wiki](https://dlc.wiki) started the same way - collection of bookmarks about discreet log contracts. I'm not actively researching DLCs at the moment due to other priorities, but it has been kept up to date by amazing efforts of Rsync.

### lightning-network.tech

While not under heavy maintenance (I've put my getting rich from routing fees dream on hold) there is still lots of useful resources for lightning network node operators in this one. And I still do add an occasional link here and there, its just not updated very frequently.

### lightning-landscape.net (under construction)

Lightning landscape was a more serious attempt to create a better directory with easier crowd participation (pull requests can be a high barrier to entry for non-technical crowd). Sadly it is currently under construction due to cost cutting - in the spirit of building it fast it was built with several SaaS solutions duct taped together which became costly over time for a project that is not generating any revenue.

### world-backup

I created [world-backup](https://world-backup) as an attempt to create a list of essential information needed in SHTF scenarios. A curated list of manuals and critical data like maps that everyone can put on a portable drive and have it with them.

Hopefully I managed to remember them all. And even more importantly, hopefully they helped someone at some point.
