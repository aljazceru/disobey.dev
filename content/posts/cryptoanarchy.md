Over time I've been slowly hoarding and studying a lot of old(er) crypto anarchy and cypherpunk materials over time, like the the [untold story of the greatest crypto project ever that I've posted about before](https://disobey.dev/the-untold-story-of-the-greatest-crypto-project-ever/).

I've been running my own backup of anarplex in case Eric Sirion's ever goes offline. I also have copies of other materials like Taz0 and second realm series from liberty under attack podcast etc. I've decided that I want to expand on the works of [cryptoanarchy.wiki](https://cryptoanarchy.wiki/?ref=disobey.dev) and create (another) directory with everything I deed worthy of preserving and studying. Over time I plan to actually pack all the data into a torrent and make sure it is distributed around so the wisdom of those before us does not go to waste.

If you have any suggestions of what to put on the [cryptoanarchy.info](https://cryptoanarchy.info) website [contact me](https://disobey.dev/contact/) or open an issue/PR on the [repo](https://github.com/cryptoanarchy-info/cryptoanarchy-archive?ref=disobey.dev).
