The author describes an initiative to archive and preserve historical cryptocurrency and cypherpunk materials. According to the piece, the creator has been "slowly hoarding and studying a lot of old(er) crypto anarchy and cypherpunk materials over time."

The project involves maintaining backups of various resources, including anarplex archives and podcast series content. The author aims to expand upon existing work found at cryptoanarchy.wiki by establishing a comprehensive directory of materials deemed significant for historical preservation.

Future plans include packaging the accumulated materials into a torrent format to ensure wider distribution. The author states the goal is to prevent "the wisdom of those before us does not go to waste."

The initiative welcomes community contributions. Interested parties can submit suggestions through the contact page or contribute directly via the GitHub repository at cryptoanarchy-archive.

The website is accessible at cryptoanarchy.info and serves as a digital preservation effort for cypherpunk and crypto-anarchist literature and resources.
