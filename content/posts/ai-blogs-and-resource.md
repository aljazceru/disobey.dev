In a world of explosive amount of content about AI and where NOT having an AI newsletter has become a rarity there are a few authors and sites I like to read for their more thoughtful and long form content:

## Recommended Resources

The following sites are highlighted for substantive coverage:

- **gwern.net** - Features deep learning content alongside other topics
- **ym2132.github.io** - Focuses on extended posts about generative adversarial networks
- **simonwillison.net** - Combines Python and AI topics
- **retrochronic.com** - Explores intersections of AI and philosophy

## Video Content

For visual learners, the author recommends the AI Explained YouTube channel as an additional resource.

## Notes

The author indicates this collection may be expanded or updated in the future, suggesting it serves as an evolving curation rather than a definitive list.
