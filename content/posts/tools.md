I've created a subpage on this site dedicated to various tools (the subset of them that are mature enough for me to dare mention them) -> you can find them [here](https://disobey.dev/tools/).

I do not commit to any level of regular maintenance of them, they get fixed when they need fixing (which is usually when I'm in a rush to do something and I realize everything is broken). 

Occasionally these things find a life of their own, I've created a simple script to have [data retention policies](https://github.com/aljazceru/mattermost-retention) in free version of mattermost in January 2018 for a project I was consulting on and promptly forgot about it. Over the years it appeared that several people found it rather useful - it got regular updates, support for additional database type and more. That is a long way of saying feel free to submit a PR.
