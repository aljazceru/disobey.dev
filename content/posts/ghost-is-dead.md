Its been probably several months since i've been postponing migrating from ghost to something else. Ghost served me well but I wanted something simple, markdown based that I can move around and host easily. Ghost needs updating, database management, backups etc. Its not that hard to maintain but its more work than I want to do for a simple blog. 

So here it is, mostly migrated content from ghost to hugo. Likely something is broken or missing. I haven't migrated all the posts as rewriting history is man's favorite pastime.

Let see how long I stick with this theme (at the time of writing - PaperMod). Its not my favorite but you can only procrastinate so much with overthinking the theme for a blog that noone reads..
