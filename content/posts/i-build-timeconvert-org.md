No cookies, no banners, no analytics, no frameworks, no junk. Good old web 1.0. html + css + javascript. -> [timeconvert.org](https://timeconvert.org/?ref=disobey.dev)

A while back I've had one too many timestamp conversion cases to deal with while building some data ingestion pipeline and I've ended up creating this website to scratch my own itch.

I know epoch converter exists but it has tons of popups/cookie consent banners, you need to paste into the correct text box and it just feels bulky. I wanted something to just paste whatever time format I have and it will give me the alternatives.

Then while figuring out on which of my domains to publish this to have it handy I got carried away, looked at what would make sense given the keyword analytics and bought a domain. Because I obviously needed another one.

LLM's are a big enabler of procrastination driven development.
