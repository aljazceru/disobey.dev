The author created a minimalist timestamp conversion website emphasizing simplicity and user experience. They describe the project as featuring "No cookies, no banners, no analytics, no frameworks, no junk. Good old web 1.0. html + css + javascript."

The motivation stemmed from frustration with existing solutions. While acknowledging that epoch converter tools already exist, the creator found them problematic due to excessive popups and cookie consent requests. They wanted a streamlined alternative where users could "paste whatever time format I have and it will give me the alternatives."

The author notes an interesting development decision-making process: after building the tool, they spent time analyzing keyword analytics and purchased a dedicated domain (timeconvert.org) specifically for hosting it. They humorously reflect on this scope creep, attributing it partly to how "LLM's are a big enabler of procrastination driven development."

The site represents a deliberately back-to-basics approach to web development, prioritizing user privacy and simplicity over modern frameworks and tracking mechanisms.
